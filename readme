How to run the applet:

1. Open toy.html in a web browser (Chrome recommended). You may want to zoom in/out on the SVG according to personal viewing preference.
2. Open the debugger console (option+command+i on Mac). I recommend the right dockside view for ease of use.
3. The program takes console commands of the form

       > main('10100101', '00101111', 'add', .0001)

   where args[0] and args[1] must be strings representing 8-bit binary numbers,
   args[2] must be one of 'add', 'xor', 'and'
   args[3] is an optional animation delay parameter in ms (I suggest using a very small value).

4. Once the simulation concludes, the 8-bit binary result can be read from left-to-right from the bottom output buses (red=1, grey=0).

***IMPORTANT***
Please note that the solution printed as console output is only accurate when animation delay is set to 0.
(The bug has to do with the fact that our simulation function is async, and the program evaluates the CSS
class values of the output wires (all off by default) before the simulation concludes.)
